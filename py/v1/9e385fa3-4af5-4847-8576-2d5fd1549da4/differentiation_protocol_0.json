        "protocol_description": "We constructed an hESC line with Citrine (Cit) fused to the endogenous copy of the DCX gene in the H1 parent line (WAe001-A RRID:CVCL_9771) to allow us to profile neurons (Cit+) and progenitors (Cit\u2212) (Yao et al., 2017). hESCs were seeded for a 10-day cortical induction phase in NIMX media with SMAD inhibitors; reseeded for the ventralization phase at D10 in culture media containing Shh and purmorphamine, and finally at D24 for neural differentiation with neurogenic/neurotrophic factors BDNF, GDNF, NT3, and cAMP. The protocol was ended at D125."
