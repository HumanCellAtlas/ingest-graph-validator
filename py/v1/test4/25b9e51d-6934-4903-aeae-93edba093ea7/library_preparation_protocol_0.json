        "protocol_description": "Single cells are first isolated into individual wells using FACS. Each cell is lysed, and the 3' ends of mRNAs are annealed to unique molecular identifiers containing a T7 promoter. The mRNA is reverse-transcribed to generate the first cDNA strand and treated with exonuclease I to remove leftover RT primers. Next, the cellular lysates are pooled together and converted to double-stranded cDNA. The DNA strands are transcribed to RNA and treated with DNase to remove leftover DNA templates in the mixture. The RNA strands are fragmented and annealed to sequencing adapters, followed by RT to generate barcoded cDNA libraries that are ready for sequencing.",
