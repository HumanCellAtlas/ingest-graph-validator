They were from 2 E18 C57BL/6 mice dissected on the same day, shipped overnight on ice, and stored at 4C until being prepared for scRNA-Seq. Brain tissues were dissociated following the Demonstrated Protocol for Mouse Embryonic Neural Tissue (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-dissociation-of-mouse-embryonic-neural-tissue-for-single-cell-rna-sequencing). 69 scRNA-Seq libraries were made from first mouse brain 2 days after the dissection. Another 64 scRNA-Seq libraries were made from second mouse brain 6 days after the dissection."
