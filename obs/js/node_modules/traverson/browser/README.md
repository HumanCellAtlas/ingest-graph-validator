This folder contains all things related to using Traverson in the browser.:w

Here is a short description of what each subfolder contains:

* dist: An optimized (concatenated and minified) single-file build that can be used in the browser in production.
* example: An example html page that shows how Traverson works in the browser.
* lib: Special libraries that are used by Traverson in the browser. If you use the build from the `dist` folder, you do not need these.
* test: A test harness to run the mocha tests in the browser.
