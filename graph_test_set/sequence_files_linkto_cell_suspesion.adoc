## Test: Sequence files link to cell suspension

#### Test description

The biomaterial linked to the process linked to a sequence file must be a cell suspension.

This next query should provide all the subgraphs in the form (file)-(process)-(biomaterial).

----
MATCH path = (b:biomaterial)-[:INPUT_TO_PROCESSES]->(p:process)<-[:DERIVED_BY_PROCESSES]-(f:file)
WHERE b:cell_suspension
RETURN f.`file_core.file_name`, b.`biomaterial_core.biomaterial_id`
----

#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path = (b:biomaterial)-[:INPUT_TO_PROCESSES]->(p:process)<-[:DERIVED_BY_PROCESSES]-(f:file)
WHERE NOT b:cell_suspension
RETURN f.`file_core.file_name`, b.`biomaterial_core.biomaterial_id`
----

[NOTE]
===============================
* Each cypher snippet in '_violation.adoc' will be ran.
* The test passes if the cypher query returns no results.
* `True` is a pass, `False` is a fail.
* These tests can be renamed and added to as required.
