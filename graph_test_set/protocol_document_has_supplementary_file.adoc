## Test: If a protocol has a document, a matching supplementary file must exist

#### Test description

If a protocol defines a supplementary file as the document describing it, there must exist a supplementary file that
is named exactly the same.

If any filenames are returned by this test, that means those files are missing as they are specified in protocols and
do not exist.


#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:protocol), (n:supplementary_file)
WITH p, COLLECT (n.`file_core.file_name`) AS filenames
WHERE NOT p.`protocol_core.document` IN filenames
RETURN p.`protocol_core.document`
----
