## Test: All files which are not a supplementary file must have a link

#### Test description

Files must be attached to something, unless they are a supplementary file. Those will be covered in other test.

The next query should help show the files which are not supplementary files and their first link, for visual checks:

----
MATCH (n:file)
WHERE NOT n:supplementary_file
CALL apoc.path.expand(n, "", "-project|", 0, 1) YIELD path
RETURN path
----


#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:file)-[r]-()
WHERE NOT n:supplementary_file AND size( (n)-[]-() ) = 0
RETURN n
----
