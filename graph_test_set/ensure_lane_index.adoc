## Test: ensure_lane_index

#### Test description

If more than one R1/R2/I1/I2 in a set, then ensure lane indices are specified.

If more than one set of R1/R2/I1/I2 SEQUENCE_FILEs belong to a single  process (sequencing experiment) AND those files lack any lane_index, then this snippet returns an error.
