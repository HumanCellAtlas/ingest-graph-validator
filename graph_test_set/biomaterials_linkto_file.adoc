## Test: All biomaterials connect to a file

#### Test description

Following edges directionally downstream from all biomaterials eventually reaches a data file entity. These are currently 'sequence_file' and 'image_file'.

#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH path=(a:biomaterials)<-[:DERIVED_FROM *]-(b)
WHERE a.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND NOT size(()-->(b)) > 0
AND NOT b.specificType IN ['sequence_file', 'image_file']
RETURN b
