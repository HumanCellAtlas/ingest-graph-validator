## Test: Data file to donor path is greater than 5 hops

#### Test description

There should be a minimum of 5 jumps from the data file and the donor node. As each biomaterial is connected by a process there are two jumps between each biomaterial. This test just checks that the path is > 5.

#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH p = (a:files)-[:DERIVED_FROM *]->(b:biomaterials)
WHERE a.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND b.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND b.specificType = 'donor_organism'
AND length(p) <  5
RETURN p
