## Test: Processes using 10x library preparation protocols have 2 or more files linked

#### Test description

Processes using 10x library preparation protocols have 3 or 4 files linked.



#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (r:library_preparation_protocol)<-[:PROTOCOLS]-(p:process)<-[d]-(f:file)
WITH r, p, COUNT(d) as num_files
WHERE r.`library_construction_method.ontology_label` =~ "10[xX] ([35]' ){0,1}v[1-3] sequencing" // 10x v2 and v3
AND NOT 2 <= num_files <= 4 // Number of files is more than 1 and less than 5
RETURN num_files
