## Test: Sequence files should be derived from a cell suspension

#### Test description

This test ensures that the biomaterial upstream of the process connected to a sequencing file is a cell suspension.

#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH x = (b:biomaterials)<-[:DERIVED_FROM]-(p:processes)<-[:DERIVED_FROM]-(f:files)
WHERE b.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND p.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND f.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND f.specificType = 'sequence_file'
AND NOT b.specificType = 'cell_suspension'
RETURN b
