## Test: Sequencing files are linked to appropriate protocols

#### Test description

The first process upstream of a sequencing file should have two links to protocols and those should be 'library_preparation_protocol' and 'sequencing_protocol'.


#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (d:Protocol)<-[r:protocols]-(p:Process)<-[:derivedByProcesses]-(f:File)
WHERE f.describedBy CONTAINS "sequence_file"
AND NOT size((p)-[:protocols]-()) = 2
OR NOT (r.describedBy CONTAINS "sequencing_protocol" AND r.describedBy CONTAINS "library_preparation_protocol")
RETURN p
