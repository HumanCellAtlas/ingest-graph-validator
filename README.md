# ingest-graph-validator
Prototype code for ingest metadata graph validation. This is to test assumptions that are not encoded in the schema. For example, we would like a warning if a bundle links a donor directly to a sequencing file. This will eventually be an integrated user tool to run before submission to check that linking and data modelling have been done correctly.
