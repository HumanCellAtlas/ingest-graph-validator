#### The test
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH x = (d:protocols)<-[r:IMPLEMENTS]-(p:processes)<-[:DERIVED_FROM]-(f:files)
WHERE f.specificType = 'image_file'
AND d.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND p.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND f.submissionID = '{submissionID}'
AND NOT (size((p)-[:IMPLEMENTS]-()) = 2 OR d.specificType IN ['imaging_preparation_protocol', 'imaging_protocol'])
RETURN p
