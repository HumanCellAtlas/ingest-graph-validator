        "protocol_description": "To generate single cell suspensions, hESC-derived cultures were dissociated from plates using Accutase (ThermoFisher) at 37C. Light trituration using a P1000 pipette was done every 5 min until nearly all clumps had been dissociated (up to 1 h). Cell suspension was washed and filtered through a 40 um cell strainer. Cells were washed in PBS with 1% FBS and stained with 0.5-1 ug/mL DAPI. Single-cell suspensions were loaded onto a FACSAria II SORP (Becton Dickinson) and sorted directly into PCR strip tubes or plates held in chilled aluminium blocks. Doublets and dead cells were excluded based on forward scatter, side scatter and DAPI fluorescence. Sorting was done using the 130 um nozzle with the sort mode set to single cell. Accuracy of single-cell sorts was confirmed by sorting DAPI-stained fixed cells onto a dry well of a 96-well plate and analyzing by fluorescence microscopy."
