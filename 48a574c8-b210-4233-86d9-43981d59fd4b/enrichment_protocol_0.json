Doublets  and  dead  cells  were  excluded  based  on  forward  scatter,  side  scatter  and  DAPI fluorescence. Sorting was done using the 130  \u03bcm nozzle with the sort mode set to single cell. Accuracy of single-cell  sorts  was  confirmed  by  sorting  DAPI-stained  fixed  cells  onto  a  dry  well  of  a  96-well  plate  and  analyzing  by fluorescence microscopy."
