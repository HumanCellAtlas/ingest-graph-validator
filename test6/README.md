This dataset contains a small selection (1 page therefore up to 10) bundles from each dataset in the cbeta release so we can look at the variety of graph shapes. Getting a full list of the special links is estimated to take around 6 days to generate with the current prototype code.

Coupled to this dataset is the feature enhancement to
- only save one graph png per unique graph structure found
- iterate through multiple files at once
- save out a csv report
